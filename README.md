## Problem Statement

Atliq Hardwares, one of India's premier computer hardware producers with a growing international presence, is embarking on an exciting new journey. They've recognized the need to enhance their decision-making capabilities with smarter, faster, and more data-driven insights. To achieve this, the company is expanding their data analytics team and are on the lookout for talented junior data analysts.

### Task List

# Task List

1. **Dive into the Ad Hoc Requests**: Open the `ad-hoc-requests.pdf` file to discover 10 unique business challenges that need the analytical insights.
2. **Craft the Perfect SQL Query**: Utilize SQL skills to extract and analyze the necessary data to address each of these requests.
3. **Engage Top-Level Management**: Create a compelling presentation to showcase the findings, tailored specifically for our top-level management team.
4. **Unleash Your Creativity**: Make the presentation stand out! Incorporate audio or video elements for added impact and higher evaluation weightage.

## Techniques Mastered During This Project

### 1. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
   - Streamlined complex queries and improved readability with CTEs.
   - Simplified the process of breaking down large queries into manageable parts.

### 2. Joins
   - Mastered the art of combining data from multiple tables.
   - Learned to use different types of joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL) to retrieve comprehensive datasets.

### 3. Sub-Queries
   - Enhanced query efficiency by nesting queries within other queries.
   - Developed skills in using sub-queries for filtering, aggregating, and deriving new data.

### 4. Aggregation and Group-By
   - Utilized aggregation functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc.) to summarize data effectively.
   - Grouped data for insightful analysis, identifying patterns and trends.

### 5. Window Functions
   - Applied window functions to perform calculations across sets of rows related to the current row.
   - Gained proficiency in using functions like ROW_NUMBER, RANK, and OVER to achieve advanced data analysis.

## Project Outcome: Empowered with Data and Visualization Skills
Throughout this project, not only did I master advanced SQL techniques such as CTEs, joins, sub-queries, aggregation, and window functions, but I also honed my ability to harness the power of Power BI. I seamlessly connected MySQL databases to Power BI, transforming raw data into compelling visual stories that drive informed decisions.
